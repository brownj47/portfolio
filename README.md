# Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio page. I built it using React.js because I wanted to showcase my projects in a concise and good looking format. It contains a short bio page, tiles showcasing my projects, a Resume page, and a (non-functional as of now) Contact form. 

Visit this (link)[https://brownj47.github.io/portfolio/] to see it deployed!

## Installation

If you would like to use my code as a basis for your own website, clone the repo, run 'npm i' in the root directory for the project, and then 'npm start'. There should now be a webpage live at http://localhost:3000/.
